# About me

Hello, I'm aldess, a french teenager with passion for technology and coding. I started learning web development to make a website to access restricted websites on the school tablet. Since then, I've learnt a lot and made a lot of websites. I'm now learning frameworks such as Next.js which my portfolio is made with to create bigger projects.
